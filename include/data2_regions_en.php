        <p>Sinnoh has fourteen towns and villages as well as three "areas" and a Pokémon league.
        Cities interact with each other and form a functional society.The combat area,
        The survival area and the relaxation area are not considered to be cities but rather
        like full tourist destinations.These three areas are outside the
        continental part of Sinnoh.This part of Sinnoh is considered as a sub -region to
        The image of the Sevii Islands for the regions of Kanto and Johto.Thus, Sinnoh has a total of
        Eighteen "cities", the greatest number in a region of the Pokémon world. </p>
        <p> The Sinnoh region has thirty different routes allowing you to move from a
        place to another with ease for any trainer.Like Hoenn, Sinnoh\'s roads
        are numbered so as not to follow the sequence of roads already known to others
        regions.Sinnoh roads are numbered from 201 to 230. As said before and
        Compared to previous generations, Sinnoh has very few channels.In
        revenge, it has many winding, mountainous, rainy roads, and
        Some covered with snow.The introduction of more advanced climatic conditions
        that in the third generation make it possible to browse unpublished landscapes such as
        snowy roads in the north of the region.Another novelty is the change in
        direction and length of certain roads such as route 210 and 212 which have all
        Two two branches of the same length.Hoenn route 114 already changed direction but
        was not so long, which suggests that the Game Boy Advance was limited for
        Make such a scale. </p>
        <p> Even if it has few channels, the Sinnoh region is still rich in
        Water and consists of three lakes, the Lake Knowing to the North, Lake Truth in the West and the Lake
        Courage in the east.The latter are the residences of the three minds.Near the lake courage is
        find a fourth hidden lake: the goodbye to the source path near the
        Return cave.Sinnoh offers other remarkable places such as Mount Cown and its
        Mountain chain dividing the region in two.The vestigion forest located in the center
        West of the region is the largest Sinnoh forest.The Grand Marais, north of Verchamps
        is a place where endemic and rare species live in Pokémon and is in a certain way
        a real safari area for trainers.</p>'
