He has a dark blue head with a mainly white face and a small yellow beak. The feathers from the top of his head extend along his back to form his tail, as well as around his neck, which gives the impression that he carries a cape. He has two white and oval spots on his belly as well as a light blue pattern between his two eyes and above his beak which looks like a crown. He has arms that look like fins and yellow feet with three toes each. </p> <p> <strong> tiplouf </strong> has a great sense of personal pride. Because of this pride, he has a lot of trouble accepting and getting used to the food that humans give him, as well as to create links with his trainer. He swells his belly to avoid hurting himself if he falls, which owes him his weak and clumsy walk. However, there is no less an excellent swimmer, who can remain in apnea under the water almost ten minutes when it is to hunt. It is shown in the animated that it can also fly over short distances. You can see it on the edges when the climate becomes colder.',
